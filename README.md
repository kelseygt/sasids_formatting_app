# sasids_formatting_app

The Colorado Department of Education requires public universities to upload SASIDs (State Assigned Student Identifiers) to their SEES (Student Engagement Evaluation System) every semester. SASIDs are a unique ten-digit number assigned to each student by CDHE for the purpose of identifying students and tracking their progress through the Colorado education system. 

Uploads are required in a very specific format, and this R code takes existing SPSS files of student data and automates the formatting process for upload.
